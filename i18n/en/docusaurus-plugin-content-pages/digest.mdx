**Daily Digest - COVID-19 IN FRANCE** is a website that presents daily COVID-19 statistics and news in France in the form of a daily digest.

<p>
  It records the outbreak of COVID-19 in France from 1 March 2020, the day after the cumulative number of confirmed
  cases in France reached 100 (France had 100 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 29/2 and confirmed 30 more cases
  on 1/3, bringing the total number to 130). It is currently updated as of{" "}
  <Link to={`/digest/2021/${monthEnLower(lDate.m)}/${lDate.d}`}>
    {lDate.d} {getMonthName(lDate.m, 'en')} 2021
  </Link>
  .
</p>

A digest will normally contain:

- **Official Statistics**: French official statistics of that day
- **Daily News Highlights**: Covid-19 news in France (currently only available in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese)

In addition, each week there is a digest of the weekly epidemiological update in France (also only available in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese at the moment).

<div className="comment--translc_gray">
  Note: The official statistics is only available from 2 March 2020, i.e. from Daily Digest Day 2.

All data sources can be found in [Sources](digest/sources) in Appendix. If you have any questions or find any errors, you can contact me via the [contact information](about#contact) in the [About page](about).

Feel free to share this website and even consider [supporting it by buying me a cake](about#supportthis-website). I hope this website helps you get a better insight into the pandemic situation in France.

Best wishes and stay safe.
