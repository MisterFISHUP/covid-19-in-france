## Wording and translation {#wording-and-translation}

<h3>üè° Care Facilities</h3>

For French care facilities, this website uses the following English translations.

| French name | Translation         | French full form                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EHPAD       | EPHAD               | √©tablissement d'h√©bergement pour personnes √¢g√©es d√©pendantes |
| EMS         | EMS                 | √©tablissement m√©dico-social                                  |
| USLD        | long-term care unit | unit√© de soins de longue dur√©e                               |

**EHPAD** and **EMS** literally mean _accommodation establishment for dependent elderly people_ and _medico-social establishment_, and can both correspond to **nursing home, retirement home or old people's home** in English. This website decided to keep the French names for these two terms.

## Formatting {#formatting}

### üìÜ Date {#date}

This website uses **day-month-year** order for dates (except for dates in image file names, which use the YYYY-MM-DD format).

<div className="comment_block">For example: 31/12/2020, 31/12, 31 December</div>

### üî£ Punctuation {#punctuation}

English sentences follow English punctuation rules. French sentences follow French punctuation rules.

<div className="comment_block">
For example: In French, a space is needed <ul style={{margin: 0}}><li>before question marks and exclamation marks</li><li>before and after colons and semicolons</li></ul></div>

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Numbers {#numbers}

For ease of reading, the whole part of a number is separated by a comma for every three digits (called **a thousands separator**). Of course, some figures, such as years, will remain pure numbers without any thousands separator.

Notice that in French, a **comma** is used in place of a decimal point, and a **space or period** is used as the thousands separator.

<div className="comment_block">For example: 1,234,567.89 (and 1 234 567,89 or 1.234.567,89 in French).</div>

### üß© Miscellaneous {#typesetting-miscellaneous}

When using the per cent sign %, the number immediately precedes the symbol without a space (for example: 10%).
