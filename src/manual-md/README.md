The current folder `manual-md` contains the folder `manual` that contains md files of manual content.

The relative path of any of these files should be `manual/year/month/day.md`, where `year` is a 4-digit number, and `month`, `day` are without any leading zero.

`page_generator` (python, or jupyter notebook) can generate journal pages (mdx files) in `docs` from these files of manual content.

> Remember to configure sidebar items in `sidebars.js` after generating journal pages. It's ok to have mdx not included in this sidebars file, but it can't contain any non-existing mdx.

Since files `docs/year/month_en_lower/day.mdx` are generated automatically, one should not modify them manually. More generally, one should not modify anything in these folders `docs/year/month_en_lower/` manually, since everything inside these folders should be generated automatically. Git will also ignore changes in these folders (`docs/20??/*/` in `.gitignore`).

> Git still tracks changes of those files that are not inside folders `docs/20??/*/` (e.g. `docs/2021/my_file.md`).
